        <p class="lead mb-4">I have always been captivated by how great world leaders inspire people to take action. When pondering this idea, I‚Äôm particularly drawn to a quote by Simon Sinek: ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt buy WHAT you do; they buy WHY you do it.‚Äù If I am ever to be a great leader and have a positive impact on my friends, family, and peers, I need to earn their trust and their belief in my ‚ÄúWHY.‚Äù I take great interest in how great leaders inspire the masses, as I aspire to become a great leader myself and be able to push my local community in Thailand to its fullest potential.
¬†
In my quest to finding my motivation and drive, I invested copious amounts of time studying how to be a great leader. I read dozens of management books, obsessively watched interviews of the world's best entrepreneurs, and scoured online for any bits of knowledge that might help me find my WHY. However, none of that worked until the summer where I got my first internship, where I experienced stellar leadership and learned through close observation and application. Other than just observing, my father me ordered to stock each boxes of the frozen pizza, strombolis, and sandwiches in the refrigerator that was under -18 degree celsius. After short five minutes of being exposed to that, my body almost gave up to the numbness. But I persisted to finish after another full hour. I finally had the opportunity to experience all the blood, sweat, and tears of what a true business leader has to go through daily to ensure the company‚Äôs well-being. What I had initially anticipated to be the revival of learning countless business economics theories turned into a learning experience that revitalized my intellectual curiosity.

¬†My father is another leader that I look up to and is integral in developing my own WHY. My father is a pusher; he pushes people to their limits. When I was younger, he would incessantly push me to do more than I thought I was capable of doing. He would say, ‚ÄúDo you want to be successful? You will never achieve success until you are driven and motivated.‚Äù Through the years, I have watched him work harder and harder to support the family and the community. Monetary success never satisfied him; he never paused to marvel at his achievements and pat himself on the back. I wondered why he did it, but I never really questioned ‚ÄúWHY.‚Äù Today, I understand his passion. His WHY is pushing others to realize their full potential. People follow him because of his ability to see hidden value in people and to push those people to their full potential. From him, I learned the true value of a leader, whether it‚Äôs being decisive, positive minded, and to have a close communication with your co- workers.

While I now have the groundwork set for my WHY, my journey has only just begun. With higher education on the horizon, I look forward to refining my WHY and continuing to learn from a more diverse set of leaders. I am malleable. Like newly bought Play-Doh, I am excited at the opportunity to be molded and built into a great leader by the rigors and curriculum of your institution. My passion lies in people, communities, and leadership -- business management. With my continued education, I seek to further develop my managerial skills, become a value-added person, and be someone who can contribute to the success of my local community.¬†
